/**
 * Script writing, in two passes.
 *
 * The storyboard's `dialogue` fields are stage directions — "open with a sincere
 * greeting for the occasion" — not lines. Sending those to a video model as the
 * spoken line asks it to compose the language, pronounce it and lip-sync to it
 * all at once, which is where the delivery fell apart.
 *
 *   Pass 1 — COPY.       Write the lines in natural language, for meaning and
 *                        structure. No pronunciation encoding.
 *   Pass 2 — PRONOUNCE.  Convert each line into the spoken spelling, driven by
 *                        that language's guide from the Languages library.
 *
 * Splitting them is deliberate: the copy pass stays about the ad, the
 * pronunciation pass is a mechanical transform against a rulebook the design
 * team edits, and pass 2 can be re-run alone when the guide is tuned without
 * rewriting a word of approved copy. Both are text calls costing a fraction of a
 * rupee against Rs 100+ for a video segment.
